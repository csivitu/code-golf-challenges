  Problem Statement:
  Given an array A containing N integers.
  The task is to check whether the array is Monotonic or not.
  An array is monotonic if it is either monotone increasing or monotone decreasing.
  An array A is monotone increasing if for all i <= j, A[i] <= A[j].
  An array A is monotone decreasing if for all i <= j, A[i] >= A[j].
  Print true if the given array A is monotonic else print false.

  Input Format:
  First line will contain T, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
  Each a space seperated array of numbers as input.

  Constraints:
  1 ≤ T ≤ 10
  1 ≤ N ≤ 10000
  1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10000

  Output Format:
  For each test case, output in a single line either true or false.

  Sample Input:
  2
  6 5 4 4
  5 15 20 10

  Sample Output:
  true
  false

  Explanation:
  First test case array is monotone increasing.
  The second one is neither monotone increasing nor monotone decreasing.
