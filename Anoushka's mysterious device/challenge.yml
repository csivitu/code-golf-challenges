  from the functinality provided above. Your task is to help her find if it is possible to obtain the number 1 from the number displayed on the 
  screen(n). If it is possible, you also have to find the minimum number of button presses required to reach the goal.   

  Input Format:
  A single line containing a positive integer n that is displayed on the screen.  

  Output Format:
  A single saying "Impossible" if it's not possible to achive the target or two lines saying "It is possible" followed by the minimum number of steps required.  

  Constraints:
  1<=n<=10^10

# Test cases are of 2 types - sample and hidden. Test cases are numbered.
# Each test case has an `input` and an `output`. The input and output may
# be multiline strings or optionally they can have a `file` attribute with
# the path of the file from which the input must be taken.
