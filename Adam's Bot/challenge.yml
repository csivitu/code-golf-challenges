  Problem Statement:
  Adam is a tech enthusiast and an electrical engineer. Adam has also been in love with the idea of robots since his childhood, Adam has always
  wanted to design a robot. Now, since he has accquirred the skills, he can fulfill his childhood dream. After a few weeks, Adam designs a basic
  bot than can only move in 4 directions(Up, Down, Left and Right). The bot is controlled remotely using a remote control which sends the signals 
  to the bot to move either Left or Right or Up or Down. However, there are some flaws in the bot and it ignores some of the commands recived by it. 
  Given an input signal( a combination of 'U', 'D', 'L' or 'R' commands), Adam wants to know the number of different co-ordinates the bot could end
  up at. The initial co-ordinates of the bot are (0,0)  

  Input Format:
  The first line of the input will be an integer N which will denote the number of commands.
  The second line of input will be a string of length N comprising of 'U','D','L' and 'R'.

  Output Format:
  The output will be an integer denoting the number of possible co-ordinates the bot could end up at. 

  Constraints:
  1<=N<=10^5

  Sample Input:
  4
  RRDU 

  Sample Output:
  9
  
  Explanation:
  Some of the final possible co-ordinates can be (2,0), (1,1), (1,-1), (0,0) etc.

# Test cases are of 2 types - sample and hidden. Test cases are numbered.
# Each test case has an `input` and an `output`. The input and output may
# be multiline strings or optionally they can have a `file` attribute with
# the path of the file from which the input must be taken.
