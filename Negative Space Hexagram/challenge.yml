  ## Problem Statement:
  Write a program to print a hexagram in negative space (made of whitespaces and asterisks). Take your input as the size of each triangle in the hexagram and print a line of asterisks above, below and on either sides of the hexagram. You will notice that the base of the inverted triangle starts from the n/2th (for even) and (n-1)/2th (for odd) line from the top of the vertical triangle, and vice versa.
   

  ## Input Format:
  The input is an integer n, the height of the 2 triangles. 

  ## Output Format:
  The negative space hexagram with a line of asterisks above, below and on either sides of it. 

  ## Constraints:
  1<=n<=50

  ## Sample Input:
  8 

  Sample Output:

  ******     ******

  ******** ********
  *****************

  ## Explanation:
  The input is 8, which is the length of the triangle from the top. We have a line of stars at the top and the bottom of the hexagram as well as on either sides. The first triangle (made of whitespaces) starts from the 2nd line and continues till the 9th and the second triangle starts from the 5th line and moves till the 12th.
