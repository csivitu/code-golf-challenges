  ## Problem Statement:
  Your friend has N pieces of chocolate and he is willing to share some with you, but to get those you have to play a game.
  The game goes a follow, you keep dividing the pieces into 2 equal halves(without breaking any piece) and giving one half to 
  your friend until there is no piece remaining. Whenever you divide the pieces into 2 equal halves you can eat the leftover piece 
  if any. Find the pieces of chocolate you end up getting to eat.

  ## Input Format:
  First line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. 
  T lines follow, each line contains a positive integer N. 

  ## Output Format:
  For each test case print a single line containing the number of pieces of chocolate u get to eat. 

  ## Constraints:
  1<=T<=10^4 
  1<=N<=10^15

  ## Sample Input:
  2
  1
  6 

  ## Sample Output:
  1
  2

  ## Explanation:
  In the first test case, there is only 1 piece of chocolate so u can divide it into 2 equal halves of 0 pieces and eat the leftover 1 piece. In the second test case, you can divide 6 pieces of chocolate into equal halves of 3 pieces each. Giving one half to your friend now you have 3 pieces which u can divide into 2 halves of 1 piece each and eat the leftover piece. Giving one half to your friend u have 1 piece left which you will end up eating as explained in the first test case.
