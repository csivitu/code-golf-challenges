  Problem Statement:
  Your next task on The Skeld is as follows-
  Go to the MedBay and retrieve the bag of mints. You will get three numbers alongwith the bag, ```mint``` , ```tic``` and ```tac``` . You have to check if it 
  is possible to reduce the number of mints (stored in ```mint```) to 1 using the following operations only:
  - Multiply ```mint``` by ```tic```
  - Divide ```mint``` by ```tac```
  If it is possible to reduce the value of ```mint``` to 1, print the minimum number of operations required to do so. Otherwise, print ```-1```.

  Input Format:
  The first line of the input is an integer ```mint``` which is equal to the number of mints in the bag.
  The second line of the input is an integer ```tic``` .
  The third line of the input is an integer ```tac``` .

  Output Format:
  The output is an integer which denotes the minimum number of operations required to reduce the value of ```mint``` to 1 if it is possible and ```-1``` if it is
  not possible.

  Sample Input:
  48
  3
  12

  Sample Output:
  3
  
  Explanation:
  The steps are,
  1. Divide 48 by 12 to get 4.
  2. Multiply 4 by 3 to get 12.
  3.Divide 12 by 12 to get 1.
  Hence the number of operations = 3.

# Test cases are of 2 types - sample and hidden. Test cases are numbered.
# Each test case has an `input` and an `output`. The input and output may
# be multiline strings or optionally they can have a `file` attribute with
# the path of the file from which the input must be taken.
