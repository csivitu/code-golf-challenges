  Problem Statement:
  Write a program to find the longest series of adjacent letters in a string without repetition.
   

  Input Format:
  First line contains an integer N denoting the length of string.
  Second line contains the string.

  Output Format:
  For each test case print a single line containing the maximum number of adjacent letters without repetition in a substring of the string.

  Constraints:
  1<=n<=400 

  Sample Input:
  22
  hithisisanicebcediafhg 

  Sample Output:
  9

  Explanation:
  In this test case, we input 22 and  hithisisanicebcediafhg , which contains the substring icebcediafhg, which is the longest substring with adjacent letters from a to i. These are 9 letters, so the output would be 9.
