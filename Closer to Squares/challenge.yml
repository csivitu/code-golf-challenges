  ## Problem Statement:
  Given an integer A, you can perform upto 3 operations on it. In each operation A can change to any newA such that:

  newA - (Any digit in newA) = A

  Print the minimum difference between the final value of A and any perfect square. 
   
  ## Input Format:
  First line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. 
  T lines follow, each line contains a positive integer A. 
  
  ## Output Format:
  For each test case print a single line containing the minimum difference. 
  
  ## Constraints:
  1<=T<=10^3
  1<=A<=10^9
  
  ## Sample Input:
  2
  1
  34
  
  ## Sample Output:
  0
  1
  
  ## Explanation:
  In the first test case, 1 cannot be converted into any other number through the given operations and its difference from a perfect square is 0. In the second test case, 34 can be converted into 37,41 and 45 by performing upto 3 operations. Minimum difference is when we select 37 as 37-36=1.
