  ## Problem Statement:
  There is an infinite line of Candy Stores in front of you. All of the stores are numbered- Store 0, Store 1, Store 2.... and so on. You have to pick your order from Candy Store S. However, to reach the correct store you have to either skip forward or backward by p or q stores multiple times. You are standing in front of Candy Store 0 right now. Can you successfully pick your order from Candy Store S? If you can, print 1. If not, print 0.

  ## Input Format:
  The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases.
  The first line of each test case contains an integer S which denotes the Candy Store where you should end up at.
  The second line of each test case contains an integer p .
  The third line of each test case contains an integer q .

  ## Output Format:
  The output is an integer : 1 or 0, to show if you could successfully pick your order from Candy Store S or not. 
  
  ## Constraints:
  1<T<=10000
  1<=S,p,q<=10^18

  ## Sample Input:
  1
  11
  2
  5

  ## Sample Output:
  1
  
  ## Explanation:
  You have to go to Candy Store 11.
  The steps are as follows,
  - Skip forward to Candy Store 5 (+5)
  - Skip forward to Candy Store 10 (+5)
  - Skip forward to Candy Store 15 (+5)
  - Skip backwards to Candy Store 13 (-2)
  - Skip backwards to Candy Store 11 (-2)
  11= 5+5+5-2-2
  So, the output is 1 as it is possible to reach Candy Store 11.

# Test cases are of 2 types - sample and hidden. Test cases are numbered.
# Each test case has an `input` and an `output`. The input and output may
# be multiline strings or optionally they can have a `file` attribute with
# the path of the file from which the input must be taken.
