  Problem Statement:
  Jackie is a thief who specializes in breaking into safes. On one particular case, he encounters a safe with a strange combination lock. 
  The screen would display a series of 'T' numbers and for each number, he had to sum up the digits in the even's or odd's places in the number, subject to a constraint.
  If the number displayed was in an even or odd row.
  Print the sum of even digits of a number or an odd number depending if line number is even or odd

  Input Format:
  First line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. 
  T lines follow, each line contains a positive integer A. 

  Output Format:
  if T is even, then print the sum of digits in the even positions in A, else if T is odd, print the sum of digits in odd positions in A 

  Constraints:
  1<=A<=10^15
  1<=T<=10^4

  Sample Input:
    2
    121342
    121342
  Sample Output:
    7
    6

  Explanation:
    The left most digit of a number is the first digit and numbering starts from 1.
    121342 is in row 1, which is an odd numbered row. so the output will be 1+1+4 = 6, which is the sum of digits in the odd places of the number.
    121342 is in row , which is an even numbered row. so the output would be 2+3+2 = 7 , which is the sum of digits in the even places of the number.
