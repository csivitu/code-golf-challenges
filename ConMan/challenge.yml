  ## Problem Statement:
  Jac is a thief who specializes in breaking into safes. On one particular case, he encounters a safe with a strange combination lock. The screen would display a series of 'T' numbers and for each number he had to sum up the digits in the even or odd places of the number, subject to if the number was displayed in an even or odd row respectively. Print the sum of even digits of a number or an odd number depending if line number is even or odd. The First line is numbered 1.

  ## Input Format:
  First line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. 
  T lines follow, each line contains a positive integer A. 

  ## Output Format:
  If the line number is even, then print the sum of digits in even positions of A, else, print the sum of digits in odd positions of A. 

  ## Constraints:
  1<=A<=10^15
  1<=T<=10^4

  ## Sample Input:
  2
  121342
  121342

  ## Sample Output:
  6
  7

  ## Explanation:
  The left most digit of a number is the first digit. 121342 is in row 1, which is an odd numbered row so the output will be 1+1+4 = 6, which is the sum of digits in the odd places of the number. 121342 is in row 2, which is an even numbered row so the output would be 2+3+2 = 7 , which is the sum of digits in the even places of the number.
