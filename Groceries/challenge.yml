  Problem Statement:
  Pintu's mother is super tired of the daily chroes and wants to send Pintu to the supermarket to get some groceries. But unfortunately 
  she does not trust him as she knows that if she doesnt keep an eye on him, he will buy junk snacks with the money. So Pintu's mother decides
  to give him a list of N ID numbers of the items and asks him to get as many items as he can carry(Minimum 1). She wants him to report the M items bought by 
  him so that she can make sure that he doesnt eat outside junk food during the pandemic. Help Pintu's mother by finding out if all the items 
  bought by Pintu fall in the list which she gave earlier. Duplicate items are written multiple times.
Input Format:
  First line contains an integer K, the number of test cases.
  The next lines contains 2 integers N and M. The following 2 lines contain the N ItemID's and M ItemID's respectively.
Output Format:
  For each test case, print 'YES' if all the items that Pintu got are from his mother's list and print 'NO'
  if there are 1 or more items that are different.
Contraints:
  1<=t<=10^2
  1<=N<=10^3
  1<=M<=10^3
Sample Input:
  2
  4 3
  22 33 23 1
  1 33 22
  2 3
  2 4
  3 2 4
Sample Output:
  YES
  NO
Explaination:
  In the first test case, the item's to get have id's 22,33,23 and 1. Pintu gets 1 33 22 which are all in the list.
  Due to this we print 'YES'.
  For the second test case, the item's to get have id's 2 and 4. Pintu get more than 2 items which means that he got 
  extra items. Due to this 'NO' would be printed.
