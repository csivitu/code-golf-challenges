  ## Problem Statement:
  You have the given sequence:

  f(n) = (1+log(2^n))/log(n)

  Here log is of base e. Find the sum of sequence from a(th) term to b(th) term (both inclusive) and print the sum till first c digits after decimal point.

  ## Input Format:
  First line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. 
  T lines follow, each line contains the positive integers a,b and c. 

  a - starting term of the series (inclusive)
  b - ending term of the series (inclusive)
  c - number of decimal places to display (no rounding off, just truncate)

  ## Output Format:
  For each test case print a single line containing the value of the sum to c places after decimal point. 

  ## Constraints:
  1<=T<=10^5
  2<=a<=b<=10^5
  1<=c<=5

  ## Sample Input:
  2
  3 5 2
  3 5 3

  ## Sample Output:
  8.29
  8.299

  ## Explanation:
  The sum of the series is 8.299093732712269 which when truncated to 2 decimal places is 8.29 and 3 decimal places is 8.299
