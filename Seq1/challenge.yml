  Problem Statement:
  You have the given sequence. 
  
  f(n) = (1+log(2^n))/log(n)

  where log is of base e
  
  Find the approximation of the sequence subject to the following conditions - 

  Input Format:
  First line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. 
  T lines follow, each line contains the positive integers a,b and c. 

  a - starting term of the series (inclusive)
  b - ending term of the series (inclusive)
  c - number of decimal places to display (no rounding off, just truncate)

  Output Format:
  For each test case print a single line containing the value of the approximation. 

  Constraints:
  1<=T<=10^5
  2<=a<=b<=10^5
  1<=c<=5

  Sample Input:
    2
    3 5 2
    3 5 3

  Sample Output:
    8.29
    8.299

  Explanation:
    The sum of the series is 8.299093732712269 which when truncated to 2 decimal places is 8.29 and 3 decimal places is 8.299
